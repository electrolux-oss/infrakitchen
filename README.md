## How to Use InfraKitchen in Your Organization

InfraKitchen helps teams move beyond **infrastructure operational bottlenecks** by enabling a platform engineering approach. Using InfraKitchen is simple and flexible across different roles and workflows:

### 🧱 Platform Team (or SRE, DevOps team)

The Platform Team's primary role shifts from fulfilling tickets to creating and maintaining the **core platform abstractions**:

* **Reusable templates:** Creating reusable, standardized templates for common needs like networks, databases, Kubernetes clusters, etc.
* **Define the "Golden Path":** Craft and maintain the approved, secure, and compliant **Infrastructure-as-Code templates**. These templates abstract away complexity, ensuring best practices are automatically applied for all developers.

### 👩‍💻 Developers & Application Teams

Developers are the main beneficiaries, gaining **autonomy and speed** for their service delivery:

* **Fully Self-Service Provisioning:** Use the platform to provision any cloud resources. This eliminates the need to file tickets and waiting for the infrastructure team, dramatically speeding up delivery from **weeks to minutes**.
* **Minimal Expertise Required:** Leverage predefined templates that require very little input, removing the overhead of having to be an infrastructure expert to run applications.
* **Choice of Interface:** InfraKitchen supports both the rapid, minimal-input **UI-driven** approach and the traditional **code-driven** Pull Request process for teams that prefer more control over their infrastructure.

### 🚒 On-Call Engineers & Incident Responders

The platform distributes operational ownership and simplifies incident response:

* **Accountability:** The platform makes infrastructure more visible and understandable to developers and less technical roles, such as **Product Managers**, encouraging them to own more troubleshooting responsibilities. This accelerates initial incident identification and response time.

## Highlights

- Create your Terraform module once and apply it to any account
- Control your infrastructure by logging and audit systems
- Give the full picture of your infrastructure to your developers
- Provide pre-configured, best-practice templates to accelerate development.
- Reduce the risk of developer error and misconfigurations.

## Getting started
