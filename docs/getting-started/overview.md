# What is InfraKitchen?

**InfraKitchen** is a self-service infrastructure provisioning platform that bridges the gap between platform engineering and development teams. It enables developers to deploy cloud infrastructure through a guided interface, while platform engineers maintain control, consistency, and compliance.

Built on Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles, InfraKitchen provides a structured, scalable approach to managing cloud infrastructure across multiple environments and accounts.

Platform engineers define standardized templates and best practices, while developers can deploy approved infrastructure components — without needing deep knowledge of cloud platforms or IaC tools.

## 🍽️ How InfraKitchen Helps

### **For Platform Teams**

InfraKitchen enables platform teams to:

- **Define infrastructure once** and reuse it across multiple environments and accounts.
- **Enforce standards and best practices** through controlled templates and validated variables.
- **Maintain consistency and scalability** across projects with versioned infrastructure modules.
- **Audit and log** all changes to ensure compliance, visibility, and traceability.

### **For Developers**

InfraKitchen enables developers to:

- **Provision infrastructure easily** without needing deep knowledge of cloud providers or IaC tools.
- **Select from approved templates** to deploy resources that meet organizational standards.
- **Reduce dependency on platform teams** while maintaining security and governance.
- **Work transparently** within a version-controlled and auditable workflow.

## 🚀 Quick Setup Overview

### 1. Platform Engineers

- Set up Integrations (e.g., AWS, GitHub).
- Define Templates and their relationships.
- Register Source Code Repositories and Versions.
- Configure Variables and provisioning rules.

### 2. Developers

- Select a Template and Source Code Version.
- Fill out a dynamic form generated from the Template's variables.
- Provision infrastructure with confidence.
