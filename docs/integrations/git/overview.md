# Git Providers

InfraKitchen integrates seamlessly with your existing Git workflows, supporting providers such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps.

InfraKitchen enables two powerful workflows for infrastructure management:

- First, you can maintain your infrastructure modules as version-controlled templates in your Git repositories. InfraKitchen imports these templates, ensuring that your organization’s best practices and standards are consistently applied across all projects.

- Second, when developers design new infrastructure blueprints using these templates, InfraKitchen automatically generates the required code and opens pull requests in your designated Git workspace or repository. This process allows your team to review, discuss, and approve infrastructure changes using familiar Git-based collaboration and CI/CD pipelines.

By leveraging your Git provider, InfraKitchen brings transparency, traceability, and automation to your infrastructure lifecycle, making it easy to manage changes and maintain compliance across environments.
