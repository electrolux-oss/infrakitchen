# Feature Flags

## Approval Flow

Feature flags can be used to enable or disable the approval flow for resource provisioning requests.
When enabled, requests will require approval from designated approvers before proceeding.

## Demo Mode

Demo mode can be toggled via a feature flag to allow users to explore InfraKitchen's capabilities
without making actual changes to infrastructure. This is useful for training and demonstrations.

## Websockets

Websocket support can be enabled or disabled using a feature flag.
When enabled, users will receive real-time updates on the status of their provisioning requests.
